## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.3] - 2024-03-21
### Changed
- Backport of fix for malformed, odd-length dict unpickling.

## [0.3.2] - 2022-11-01
### Changed
- Improved performance further with a few memory pools at hotspots.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-11-01
### Changed
- Better handling of escaped strings.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-11-01
### Changed
- Lots of performance enhancements. This is roughly 4x faster and uses 1/8th the
  number of memory allocations than 0.2.2 does (and about 1/3 the memory).
- API now takes []byte as argument, not io.Reader. This slice must not be
  mutated until operations (like calling JSON method) on the returned types.Object
  are completed.

## [0.2.2] - 2022-10-31
### Fixed
- Python tuples become JSON lists.

## [0.2.1] - 2022-10-27
### Fixed
- Added types.None, which was missing.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-10-27
### Changed
- Make every python object implement types.Object, and types.Object has a JSON()
  method which emits the equivalent JSON. This necessitated wrapping all the
  types which were bare Go, like bool, int, string, into named types.
  In the end, I don't emit JSON directly. I still construct the intermediate
  python objects, and then ask them to emit. This creates lots of garbage to gc,
  so I might re-explore directly emitted the JSON as as unpickle.

### forked - 2022-10-27
- forked from nlpodyssey/gopickle (or really, a child of that, nsd20463/gopickle
  b/c I wanted the improvements there)

## [0.1.0] - 2021-01-06
### Added
- More and better documentation
- `OrderedDict.MustGet()`
- `Dict.MustGet()`
- `pytorch.LoadWithUnpickler()` which allows loading PyTorch modules using a
  custom unpickler.
- Handle legacy method `torch.nn.backends.thnn._get_thnn_function_backend` when
  loading pytorch modules.

### Changed
- `FrozenSet` implementation was modified, avoiding confusion with `Set`.
- Replace build CI job with tests and coverage
- `Dict` has been reimplemented using a slice, instead of a map, because in Go
  not all types can be map's keys (e.g. slices).
- Use Go version `1.15`

### Removed
- Unused method `List.Extend`

## [0.0.1-alpha.1] - 2020-05-23
### Fixed
- Modify GitHub Action steps `Build` and `Test` including all sub-packages.

## [0.0.1-alpha.0] - 2020-05-23
### Added
- Initial implementation of `types` package
- Initial implementation of `pickle` package
- Initial implementation of `pytorch` package
